== Installation ==
= Main Plugin =
1. Upload the `store-locator` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Sign up for a Google Maps API Key for your domain. Instructions: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key
4. Add your locations through the 'Locations' page in the Store Locator admin panel
5. Place the shortcode `[STORE-LOCATOR]` in the body of a page or a post to display your store locator

= Addons =
1. Unzip & Upload the entire addon folder to the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/addons` directory
2. Activate the addon by updating the Activation Key that you receive after purchase at the bottom of the "News & Upgrades" Page

= Themes =
1. Unzip & Upload the entire theme folder to the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/themes` directory
2. Select theme from the theme dropdown menu under the "Design" section on the "MapDesigner&trade;" Page

= Icons =
1. There are some default icons in the `/wp-content/plugins/store-locator/icons` directory
2. Add your own custom icons in to `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-icons`

= Custom CSS (Stylesheet) =
1. You can modify the default 'store-locator.css' and place it under `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-css/`
2. The store locator will give priority to the 'store-locator.css' in the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-css/` folder over the default 'store-locator.css' in the main `store-locator/` folder. This allows you to upgrade the main store locator plugin without worrying about losing your custom styling.

Place any customizations that you make into the corresponding folder in the 'wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads' directory and they will be safe during upgrades to newer, better versions (For example: if place 'store-locator.css' in the 'wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-css' folder, the plugin will use those styles instead of the styles of any 'store-locator.css' in the main `store-locator` directory.  So, when an update is performed --- you don't lose your style customizations!)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Make sure to check http://docs.viadat.com for the most updated information

= I'm getting 'failed to geocode' error messages! Why? =
* Have you updated your Store Locator? [It's mandatory to be using Store Locator v2.x](http://www.viadat.com/2013/10/important-update-store-locator-v2-uses-google-maps-api-v3) if you want anything to work

= Bought the CSV Importer ... =
* Nearly all your questions [have been answered here](http://docs.viadat.com/CSV_Importer_Geocoder_Exporter_XML_Exporter). If you follow these instructions & answers exactly, you should be fine

= I'm using an updated Store Locator, but still no luck geocoding when adding a location =
* [Google's Geocoding API v3 has 2,500 geocode per day limit](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/index#Limits), so you may need to wait several hours, and try to add your locations again

= Is this plugin USA-only? / Does it support locations in multiple countries? =
This plugin in not USA-only, and yes, it supports locations all over the world -- as long as the Google Maps API properly supports it:

* On the MapDesigner admin page (v2.x), you can select your main country. This gives the Google Maps API a region to focus on
* [For non-USA addresses, use the 'State' field for the Country / Region](http://docs.viadat.com/Main_Page#How_do_I_enter_non-US_addresses.3F) containing the city & location you are submitting (regions, such as country, province, territory, arrondissement, protectorate, S.A.R, state, etc.). When you use any of these types of regions, the Google Maps API will still geocode (give coordinates) to them
* [It has been translated](http://docs.viadat.com/Main_Page#Special_Thanks_to_Translators) into 15+ languages -- if you would like to [provide a new or updated translation](http://www.viadat.com/2009/02/store-locator-translation-files-wanted-you-might-just-get-something-nice-in-return/), please do so

= Oh no! I'm seeing a 'Google Maps is disabled', or other Google Maps error messages on my website when viewing my Store Locator =
* Are you using Store Locator v1.9.7 or earlier?  You must update immediately

= If I need to rename my folder from the older 'wordpress-store-locator-location-finder' to 'store-locator', will I lose my locations? =
* No. You won't lose them. And make sure to re-select your home & end map markers in MapDesigner after renaming

= How can I have more than one Store Locator map on my website? =
* The [Multiple Mapper addon](http://docs.viadat.com/Multiple_Mapper)

= I would like to show different icons for different locations -- can that be done? =
* Yes, the [Categorizer addon](http://docs.viadat.com/Categorizer)

= Do I need a Google Account to use this store locator? =
Since Store Locator v2.x, which uses Google Maps API v3, it is not required like it was in Google Maps API v2. However, high-usage sites may still need an API key to monitor usage. Thus, if needed:

1. To sign up for a Google Account, visit: https://www.google.com/accounts/
2. To sign up for a Google Maps API Key, visit: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key

= How Do I use a Translation? =
1. Place .po & .mo translation files into the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/languages` folder, and then change the `WPLANG` constant to the corresponding language abbreviation in the `wp-config.php` file in the root wordpress directory
2. Example: to use French, make sure `lol-fr_FR.po` & `lol-fr_FR.mo` are in the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/languages` folder, then make sure to update the code in `wp-config.php` to read `define('WPLANG', 'fr_FR')`, and Voila, Il sera en francais (It will be in French).
